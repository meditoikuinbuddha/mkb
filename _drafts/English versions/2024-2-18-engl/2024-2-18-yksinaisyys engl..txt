It is a strange thing that as a monk I spend many many hours a day by myself and sometimes people as that as a monk without wife and kids are you ever lonely? Sometimes on a retreat I've been months without speaking to anyone, doesn't it get lonely?

When I've been asked that question I have to answer that I'm never lonely. I never feel that I have to be with other people. I like people, but I don't have to be with them. 

Why is that? The reason is that there is always someone around: me. Because I'm a friend of myself because I like "me" I'm always with my best friend. 

At night-time in my cave where I live I always go to sleep with my best friend: me. Because I'm at peace with myself and accept myself, understanding I'm not perfect but I'm good enough, then I'm never lonely.

Lonely people are people who don't like themselves. People who are afraid of themselves. 

So when no one else is around your with this strange and terryfying being called "me", who you haven't really made peace with yet, haven't really understood yet. 

But once you understand who you are you become at peace with yourself, you even like yourself. 

One of the greatest insight you can ever have is "I'm okay". To realize there is nothing wrong with you. As you are you are perfect. You don't believe that which is why you keep trying to change yourself.

Once you actually solve the problem of "me" no one else will be difficult for you. There won't be "difficult people" anymore because the difficulty of other people is just the projection from your own self. I've noticed many times that when people critize each other they are actually speaking of themselves.

It is amazing how people critize because it is something in their character they don't like which they project onto others. I think this is quite commong psychological trait. 

So if you can actually heal the problem by accepting yourself then you can accept just about anyone.
